## xChange

xChange is an app designed in SwiftUI for iOS that helps meet users from different parts of the globe. It uses “Letter”, in which users can create letters, through which users can share their thoughts and feelings as notes to which users within the local region can react and get in touch with. Users with premium features can get access to the global feature where they can interact with letters all over the globe. The app uses MongoDB Realm for authentication and CRUD operations as local persistence storage, and is deployed on to MongoDB Atlas whenever a trigger to the app is viewed. The app mainly focuses on how people can interact with each other, merely based on their thoughts.
